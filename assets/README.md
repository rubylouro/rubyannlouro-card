## Documentation for Business Card

In this project, I was tasked to create a personal business card that represented me as a designer. To create this site, I used mainly html and css. This business card is the first project I've done where I've handled code much more in depth. Throughout this process, I discovered how the format of my card needed a grid system. This was challenging at first mainly because I didn't have much experience in code to begin with. Amongst the challenges I faced that included working with grids and handling unruly icon containers, I had many victories too. One aspect of this project that I particularly enjoy is the custom cursor and the subtle hover effect that it has when hovering over a link. This project was definitely a learning curve for me just getting into code, but I value the challenges and new skills, and I believe it has helped me grow as a designer.
